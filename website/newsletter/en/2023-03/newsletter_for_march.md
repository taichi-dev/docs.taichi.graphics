## üåü Featured Repos & Projects

- **A 2D Eulerian fluid solver implemented**

    This is a [2D Eulerian fluid solver implemented](http://github.com/Lee-abcde/2DEulerianFluidSolver/tree/main) using the Taichi programming language, which achieves advanced functionality with a implementation of only 300 lines of code. Specifically, this solver enables interactive manipulation of the water surface through mouse interactions, as well as enhanced fluid dynamics through the addition of vorticity calculations. Additionally, this solver supports the flexibility to switch the fluid‚Äôs background image, with the images located in the designated img directory.

- **A project is based on SPH Taichi**

    [This project](https://github.com/sillsill777/SPH-Fluid-Simulation) is based on SPH Taichi. In this project with the SPH formalism, [sillsill777](https://github.com/sillsill777) will numerically solve fluid equations which govern the movement of fluid flow. Furthermore, they will consider several effects governing fluid motion such as viscosity and surface tension. The author will also handle the issue of Fluid-Rigid coupling.

- **Taichi NeRF**

   We utilized [Taichi NeRF](http://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi-nerfs) to reconstruct a corner of the Taichi office in 3D. NeRF is a technique that allows for accurate and detailed reconstruction of scenes from a series of 2D images. By capturing multiple images of the office corner from different angles, we were able to use Taichi NeRF to generate a high-quality 3D model. The resulting model can be explored and visualized from any viewpoint, providing a realistic and immersive virtual representation of the Taichi office corner.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Tips & Tricks
 
How can you perform complex number arithmetic using Taichi's math module?

A: Complex numbers can be represented using 2D vectors (ti.math.vec2). In the vec2, the two numbers represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, for example ti.math.vec2(1, 1) represents the complex number 1+1j.
