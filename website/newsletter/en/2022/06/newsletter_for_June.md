## ‚öôÔ∏è Releases & development

- **Taichi v1.0.3 released!**

    Despite being small, this latest version marks a big step towards making Taichi-Lang a superset of CUDA. If you want to utilize miscellaneous CUDA warp-level intrinsics or add a struct_class decorator, [don't miss out](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/releases/tag/v1.0.3?utm_source=twitter). Upgrade now!
  
    `pip install --upgrade taichi`
  
    `ti gallery`

## üåü Featured repos & projects

- **Awesome Taichi repo launched**

    Fancy a break from coding and get some tasty visual refreshments? We launched the [Awesome Taichi repo](https://github.com/Taichi-dev/awesome-taichi) to give you easy access to the latest collection of Taichi applications. Be it innovative image processing techniques, refreshing integration with machine learning, realistic simulation projects, or adorable voxel artworks, you shall always find your cup of tea! Or ... Better: Contribute your demos to the [Awesome Taichi repo](https://github.com/Taichi-dev/awesome-taichi) and see your hard work become a source of inspiration.üòé

    Now, a really cool starter for your first bite: [Madelbrot Viewer](https://github.com/Y7K4/mandelbrot-viewer) by [Y7K4](https://github.com/Y7K4)

- **[YuCrazing](https://github.com/YuCrazing)'s position-based fluid simulation**

    Using Taichi Lang 1.0.3, [YuCrazing](https://github.com/YuCrazing) develops a position-based fluid simulation on 260k particles and runs it on RTX3060Ti at 60fps.

    Acceleration to a staggering number of particles like this is hard, but the warp-level intrinsics introduced in 1.0.3 made it a breeze.üëá

- **Computational Fluid Dynamics resource repo launched**
    If you are interested in numerical fluid simulation, then Taichi is your handy tool. üëâ Star this [resource hub](https://github.com/houkensjtu/taichi-fluid), where you can find useful references, tutorials, and classic Taichi-empowered fluid simulation projects.

## üé§ New ideas wanted!

- **Call for suggestions on Taichi's small-matrix functions**

    Taichi has implemented some functions relating to small matrices (2x2 or 3x3), such as single value decomposition (SVD) and eigendecomposition. Click [here](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/discussions/5103) for the full list.

    However, it is far from being sufficient. We need your help to expand this function list! If you ever tried to implement a feature from scratch, then very likely many others in the community are also in urgent need of it.

    In that spirit, we encourage you to join in our [discussion](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/discussions/5103) to share your thoughts or discoveries on Taichi's small-matrix functions.
