# Taichi Developer Community

Join our community to sharpen your programming skills and interact with other Taichi developers across the world!

## 1. Code of conduct

### Pragmatic

Practically solving problems is usually our development goal. Simple, readable, and maintainable solutions are often optimal in practice.

### Focused

Quality > quantity. Please try to behave professionally and exhibit attention to details. Finishing what you started earns you _trust_ and _reputation_ in the community.

### Empathetic

Most Taichi contributors have their main jobs. Please be considerate of others, who may live in different time zones with their own lifestyles. Please think of code reviews as a limited resource and use it wisely: the more concise and polished a PR is, the sooner it will get reviewed and merged.

### Modest

Communicate politely and constructively. Please help us construct a respectful, blame-free, and inclusive community.

## 2. Structure

The developer community consists of four roles:

- Active contributor
- Reviewer
- Committer
- Technical Steering Committee (TSC) members

Our developer architecture builds on two standards, **trust** and **contribution**. Contributors who finish what they have promised will build trust and reputation in the community. See our code of conduct for more details.
