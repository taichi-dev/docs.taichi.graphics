# Translation Contribution Guide

## Welcome

As of today, Taichi is used by people from all over the world, and we always hope that
Taichi can bring graphics programming to everyone, so one of the most important tasks is
to make sure people can read Taichi documentation in their preferred natural languages,
which is `i18n` (_internationalization_).

You may have noticed that this Taichi documentation website is built and maintained by
core developers and the Taichi community together, and when it comes to i18n, we really
need and appreciate all kinds of help from the community, include but not limited to:

- Translate a page, section or even a few sentences to your preferred language.
- Proofread other translations and fix translation issues in your preferred language.
- Drive or lead a specific language's translation progress.
- ...

## How to contribute?

In order to make the i18n collaboration more efficient, we have adopted [Crowdin](https://translate.taichi.graphics/)
as the localization management platform for Taichi, which has helped a lot of open source
projects and games to streamline their localization efforts.

:::tip
Please visit [Crowdin's knowledge base](https://support.crowdin.com/joining-translation-project/#starting-translation) whenever you have questions about the detailed translation workflow, or
how to use Crowdin's online editor.
:::

In order to get started, please visit [Taichi's Crowdin page](https://translate.taichi.graphics/):

- If you see an existing target language that you'd like to contribute, feel free to go
ahead by clicking into the language and add your translation strings. Usually, translators
with proofread access would proofread your translations and approve them as soon as possible!
- If you don't see your preferred target language, or you have some questions related to its content, or youâ€™d like to be promoted to a proofreader role, please click the `Contact` link to reach out
to the project managers on the right side of the page.

Right now, translations of Taichi will show up automatically when we sync the content from
main repo to the docs repo, please feel free to contact us (create issues in the main repo)
at anytime if you don't see your contribution show up after more than 24 hours, or translation
managers don't respond to you on Crowdin.

:::tip Acknowledgement
We are working on a special acknowledgement section to shout out for people who have helped
and contributed to the `i18n` effort of Taichi language, thank you all for driving and owning
the `i18n` effort as well as helping on making graphics for **everyone**!
