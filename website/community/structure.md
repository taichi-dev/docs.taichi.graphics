# Structure

The developer community consists of four roles:

- Active contributor
- Reviewer
- Committer
- Technical Steering Committee (TSC) members

Our developer architecture builds on two standards, **trust** and **contribution**. Contributors who finish what they have promised will build trust and reputation in the community. See our code of conduct for more details.
