# Taichi Documentation Site

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6825e411-c5f7-4148-ab43-023663f41b6a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/docs-taichi-graphics/deploys)

A static documentation website built with [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) for [Taichi](https://taichi.graphics) documentation.

## For documentation contributors

To update existing documentation or create new documentation, **please do not work on this repo**, this repo uses the
[main repo](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi) as the source of truth and regularly pulls the source documentation
from the main repo here.

However, this repo hosts the un-versioned non-doc pages, such as the `community` page, you can edit those pages directly
in this repo.

## For translation contributors

**(Still under construction, coming soon...)**

We plan to use Crowdin as our primary translation collaboration platform. Please
visit our [Crowdin project page](https://crowdin.com/project/taichi-programming-language) for translation progress and contribution opportunities!

## Prerequisites

- `yarn`

1. On macOS, you can install the above by:

```bash
brew install yarn
```

2. On Debian-based Linux distribution, you can install the above by:

```bash

```

For Arch Linux, use the following command:

```bash

```

3. To install yarn on Windows, you need to install Node.js first. You can check it using `node -v‘` in the terminal. After it's verified, download the [Yarn installer(.smi)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable) from the official yarn website and install it. To verifiy the installation, use `yarn --version`.
